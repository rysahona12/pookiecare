Changes made on this Branch
Purpose of adding two features, Cart Logic and Order Form Logic

1. Added a Checkout Form
    • Located in products/forms.py
    • Introduces CheckoutForm to capture shipping/contact info plus optional note. Introduced CheckoutForm to collect shipping/contact fields and optional note; needed to validate and pre-fill user address info during checkout instead of manually parsing request. 
    • POST in the view. 

2. Added a backend for Cart/checkout:
    • In products/views.py it now includes: 
        [Line 79-124] add-to-cart, 
        [Line 127-146] cart display, 
        [Line 149-176] quantity update, 
        [Line 179-190] remove item, 
        [Line 193-248] checkout flow (stock-aware, saves user address info, completes order) and passes cart counts to templates
    • The new views let authenticated users add items (respecting available_stock), edit/remove them, and run complete_order() to decrement stock—otherwise the cart/order models would stay unused. 
    • In products/urls.py: Registered routes (cart, add_to_cart, update_cart_item, remove_cart_item, checkout) so the new views are reachable; previously only home/product detail were exposed.
      
3. Frontend updates:
    • In products/templates/products/home.html: refreshed header/cart badge, message display, add-to-cart buttons, cleaned text, and price formatting. 
    • In products/templates/products/product_detail.html: added cart link, message display, quantity add-to-cart form, and styling refinements. 
    • Added new, in products/templates/products/cart.html: cart page with line items, quantity updates, removal, totals, and checkout CTA (call to action). New page to render Order.items with quantity updates/removal and total; needed a UI to exercise the cart endpoints.
    • Added new, in products/templates/products/checkout.html: checkout form tied to CheckoutForm, order summary, and submit action. New page to render CheckoutForm plus order summary and submit to checkout_view; needed to capture required fields and complete orders with stock validation.
      
In Summary:
    I. Added a cart flow because the project needed users to save products, review them later, and adjust quantities/removals before buying. 
    II. Added an order/checkout flow because placing an order requires capturing shipping/contact details and validating stock before completion. 
    III. Updated templates to surface these flows in the UI (cart badge, add-to-cart buttons, cart page, checkout form) so the backend logic is reachable and usable.
